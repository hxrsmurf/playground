# Notes

I subscribed to GeforceNow, but cannot play beta/alpha (properties of game and selec that). Maybe I can follow these steps and set up EC2 w/ GPU & Spot Instance?

The main game I am playing is Ready or Not. It took about an hour or so to download and install. Then, the "Stream" function in Steam did not work. I'm not sure why.
